Welcome to ZooMumba, your crazy zoo adventure! My name is Sonja, and I’ll guide you step by step on how the game works.<br><br>In the shop, you can buy various animal enclosures and place them on your zoo grounds.
Click on the enclosure and buy an animal. Make sure to check whether you’re purchasing a male or a female.<br><br> If you have both in the enclosure, you can soon expect baby animals!
Take care of your animals regularly, cuddle them, and play with them. That way, they will be happy and satisfied. Give it a try!
You need to connect your enclosures, buildings, and attractions with paths leading to the entrance so that visitors can admire everything.
Get feed and everything your animals desire in the shop: meat, fruit, grass - just take a look around!
From level 2, you can also get buildings and stalls in the shop, making your zoo even more attractive to visitors. <br><br>You can regularly collect your entrance fee earnings from the main building.
You’ll start with a few ZooDollars. Use them to get great animals and special attractions, or hire assistants. They’ll help you with the upkeep and care of your zoo. <br><br>And if you run out of ZooDollars, don’t worry! You can top them up anytime at the ZooBank.
The more visitors you welcome to your zoo, the more trash you'll need to clean up. <br><br>Keep your zoo clean and collect the trash. Your visitors will appreciate it!
The more satisfied visitors your zoo has, the higher your zoometer will rise. <br><br>Get to work and build the best zoo in the world - in ZooMumba! Have fun!
